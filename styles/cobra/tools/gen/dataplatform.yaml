  title: IONOS Cloud - Managed Stackable Data Platform API
  description: |
    Managed Stackable Data Platform by IONOS Cloud provides a preconfigured Kubernetes cluster
    with pre-installed and managed Stackable operators. After the provision of these Stackable operators,
    the customer can interact with them directly
    and build his desired application on top of the Stackable platform.
    
    The Managed Stackable Data Platform by IONOS Cloud can be configured through the IONOS Cloud API
    in addition or as an alternative to the "Data Center Designer" (DCD).
    
    ## Getting Started
    
    To get your DataPlatformCluster up and running, the following steps needs to be performed.
    
    ### IONOS Cloud Account
    
    The first step is the creation of a IONOS Cloud account if not already existing.
    
    To register a **new account** visit [cloud.ionos.com](https://cloud.ionos.com/compute/signup).
    
    ### Virtual Data Center (VDC)
    
    The Managed Stackable Data Platform needs a virtual data center (VDC) hosting the cluster.
    This could either be a VDC that already exists, especially if you want to connect the managed data platform
    to other services already running within your VDC.
    Otherwise, if you want to place the Managed Stackable Data Platform in a new VDC or you have not yet created a VDC,
    you need to do so.
    
    A new VDC can be created via the IONOS Cloud API, the IONOS Cloud CLI (ionosctl), or the DCD Web interface.
    For more information, see the [official documentation](https://docs.ionos.com/cloud/getting-started/tutorials/data-center-basics)
    
    ### Get a authentication token
    
    To interact with this API a user specific authentication token is needed.
    This token can be generated using the IONOS Cloud CLI the following way:
    
    ```
    ionosctl token generate
    ```
    
    For more information [see](https://docs.ionos.com/cli-ionosctl/subcommands/authentication/token-generate)
    
    ### Create a new DataPlatformCluster
    
    Before using the Managed Stackable Data Platform, a new DataPlatformCluster must be created.
    
    To create a cluster, use the [Create DataPlatformCluster](paths./clusters.post) API endpoint.
    
    The provisioning of the cluster might take some time. To check the current provisioning status,
    you can query the cluster by calling the [Get Endpoint](#/DataPlatformCluster/getCluster) with the cluster ID
    that was presented to you in the response of the create cluster call.
    
    ### Add a DataPlatformNodePool
    
    To deploy and run a Stackable service, the cluster must have enough computational resources. The node pool
    that is provisioned along with the cluster is reserved for the Stackable operators.
    You may create further node pools with resources tailored to your use-case.
    
    To create a new node pool use the [Create DataPlatformNodepool](paths./clusters/{clusterId}/nodepools.post)
    endpoint.
    
    ### Receive Kubeconfig
    
    Once the DataPlatformCluster is created, the kubeconfig can be accessed by the API.
    The kubeconfig allows the interaction with the provided cluster as with any regular Kubernetes cluster.
    
    The kubeconfig can be downloaded with the [Get Kubeconfig](paths./clusters/{clusterId}/kubeconfig.get) endpoint
    using the cluster ID of the created DataPlatformCluster.
    
    ### Create Stackable Service
    
    To create the desired application, the Stackable service needs to be provided,
    using the received kubeconfig and
    [deploy a Stackable service](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/getting_started.html#_deploying_stackable_services)
    
    ## Authorization
    
    All endpoints are secured, so only an authenticated user can access them.
    As Authentication mechanism the default IONOS Cloud authentication mechanism
    is used. A detailed description can be found [here](https://api.ionos.com/docs/authentication/).
    
    ### Basic Auth
    
    The basic auth scheme uses the IONOS Cloud user credentials in form of a Basic Authentication Header
    accordingly to [RFC7617](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617)
    
    ### API Key as Bearer Token
    
    The Bearer auth token used at the API Gateway is a user-related token created with the IONOS Cloud CLI.
    (See the [documentation](https://docs.ionos.com/cli-ionosctl/subcommands/authentication/token-generate) for details)
    For every request to be authenticated, the token is passed as 'Authorization Bearer' header along with the request.
    
    ### Permissions and Access Roles
    
    Currently, an admin can see and manipulate all resources in a contract.
    A normal authenticated user can only see and manipulate resources he created.
    
    ## Components
    
    The Managed Stackable Data Platform by IONOS Cloud consists of two components.
    The concept of a DataPlatformClusters and the backing DataPlatformNodePools the cluster is build on.
    
    ### DataPlatformCluster
    
    A DataPlatformCluster is the virtual instance of the customer services and operations running the managed services
    like Stackable operators.
    A DataPlatformCluster is a Kubernetes Cluster in the VDC of the customer.
    Therefore, it's possible to integrate the cluster with other resources as VLANs
    e.g. to shape the data center in the customer's need
    and integrate the cluster within the topology the customer wants to build.
    
    In addition to the Kubernetes cluster, a small node pool is provided
    which is exclusively used to run the Stackable operators.
    
    ### DataPlatformNodePool
    
    A DataPlatformNodePool represents the physical machines a DataPlatformCluster is build on top.
    All nodes within a node pool are identical in setup.
    The nodes of a pool are provisioned into virtual data centers at a location of your choice
    and you can freely specify the properties of all the nodes at once before creation.
    
    Nodes in node pools provisioned by the Managed Stackable Data Platform Cloud API are read-only in the customer's VDC
    and can only be modified or deleted via the API.

      description: |
        The Bearer auth token used at the API Gateway is a user-related token created with the IONOS Cloud CLI.
        (See the [documentation](https://docs.ionos.com/cli-ionosctl/subcommands/authentication/token-generate) for details)
        For every request to be authenticated, the token is passed as 'Authorization Bearer' header along with the request.

      type: http
      scheme: basic
      description: |
        You will need to base64 encode the string containing your credentials.
        Separate your username and password with a colon, i.e.,
        username:password and send it as 'Authorization' request header. More
